				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don’t have to overpay for a hotel room. There are tricks and tips you can use to find the best room rates so you can enjoy your trip guilt-free. Check a few of them out below:</p>
<p>1) Look into business hotels.<br />
<img class="alignright wp-image-585" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-5-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-5-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-5.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Business hotels tend to provide great deals, especially when traveling within Europe.<br />
The reason is because business can often be slow during summer months and on weekends at hotels that cater to business travelers, which can lead to lower prices.</p>
<p>2) Ask for a corner room.<br />
We also recommend opting for a corner room, since you’ll typically get more square footage for the same price. If you’re looking to upgrade to a corner room, we suggest that you be discreet and avoid asking at times when there are several guests waiting to be assisted.</p>
<p>3) Check in near the end of the day.<br />
If you’re hoping to snag an upgrade, checking in towards the end of the day might be your answer.<br />
<img class="alignleft wp-image-586" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-7-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-7-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-7.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Hotels usually have a better sense of occupancy by that point, and so they are more likely to offer upgrades that are still available.</p>
<p>4) Instead of calling the 800 reservation numbers, call the hotel directly.<br />
Often, people who are working directly at the property have a greater ability of upgrading you when possible. If you stay at a hotel regularly, keeping a friendly relationship with it and booking directly can also increase your perks.</p>
<p>5) Book within the cancellation period.<br />
<img class="alignright wp-image-562" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-61-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-61-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-61-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-61.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When it comes to hotels, sometimes waiting until the last minute can help you snag a better price tag. Typically, a hotel’s cancellation falls anywhere between 24 to 48 hours in advance, at which point rooms become available at lower rates.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of the most typical travel purchases are pretty simple commodities — albeit commodities with wildly varying prices. Unless you are upgraded somehow, on the whole a flight is a flight. Similarly, unless you are upgraded (or downgraded, as the case may be) for your car rental, a car is a car.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-576" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-32-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-32-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-32.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />But hotel rooms are a different thing entirely. A wet/small/ugly/smelly/poorly located hotel room, or a room with no Internet, a lousy view and/or a broken TV, can easily ruin a trip. While even a long-haul flight is over soon enough, and even a cramped car is a fairly comfortable form of transport compared to some alternatives, a hotel room is different for one simple reason: you have to live in it.</p>
<p>1. Don’t forget to check the exact hotel location.<br />
I once stayed in a great hotel that seemed to be in an ideal location — except that it was surrounded by extremely busy roads, including an on-ramp and off-ramp to a highway on either side of the hotel. It felt like I was staying in an interstate rest stop. I couldn’t really walk anywhere, and just stepping outside was not just annoying but borderline dangerous.</p>
<p>2. Don’t skip the review sites.<br />
Knowing as much as possible about any given property is your best strategy for getting a hotel and room that you actually enjoy staying in. When checking review sites such as TripAdvisor and Yelp over the years, almost inevitably I have switched my preferred hotel after a bit of research, as there is always something you would never know without the help of folks who have already stayed at a property.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-578 alignright" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-3-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-3-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-3.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />These might include noise, lousy food, iffy Internet, dated rooms and more — even the fact that the hotel is pretty much on a highway median.</p>
<p>3. Don’t forget to check if the hotel has an airport shuttle.<br />
I am a big fan of using public transportation when zooming around at your destination, as it puts you among the locals in a simple, straightforward way.</p>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of public transportation to and from the airport, however. Starting and (especially) ending a trip by hauling massive bags through an unfamiliar subway system can be a grueling experience, especially when you are trying to get some rare R&amp;R.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-579" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-2-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-2-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-2.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />4. Don’t fail to check parking availability and cost.<br />
If you will have your own car, you will want to check both availability and pricing on parking at the hotel. Even if the hotel has parking available, it often comes with a price tag, and can add anywhere from $10 to $35 or more to your daily hotel cost (the last two hotels I stayed at with a rental car cost $31 and $36 per day, respectively).</p>
<p>If a hotel doesn’t have its own parking, the cost can be even higher in some places where you are forced to use private lots, and you have to worry about the car getting dinged or broken into — not to mention the hassle of having to find a spot every day.</p>
<p>5. Don’t forget to factor in the cost of breakfast.<br />
<img class="wp-image-580 alignright" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-13-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-13-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-13.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The actual per-night difference between a hotel that offers a solid continental (or even full) breakfast included in the rate compared to one that offers a 23-euro buffet can be significant, to say the least.</p>
<p>You can usually find out this information on the hotel website or by calling the front desk directly. Since most folks prefer to breakfast at their hotel, this is an important question if you are concerned about your budget. Sure, you can always try to find an affordable cafe nearby, but you can’t beat a free hotel breakfast for convenience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While zeroing down on a hotel of your choice, you have to struggle hard to choose the hotel of your choice as you’ll be faced with a wide array of choices. Choosing the one that meets your needs and requirements out of the available options can prove to be a daunting task. A little bit of initial research will definitely ease your task and can really make the difference. Here we present a quick checklist that can you can seek for while booking a suitable cheap hotel online.</p>
<p>Location: Location or setting is the foremost factor. Location should be feasible and easily accessible to nearby picnic spots and other tourist attractions if you are planning a family outing. If your trip is for business purpose, then proximity to nearby town becomes crucial. Close proximity to various shopping sites and other amenities can also be a point setter in your preference list.</p>
<p>Facilities: Secondly the facilities available at hotel where you are planning to stay should have basic facilities like kids’ area &amp; swimming pool if your trip is a family trip.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-589" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-26-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-26-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-26.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While if your trip is intended for business purpose, a Wifi connection along with other business level services may prioritise your list. If you are an ardent pet lover, a pet friendly accommodation should also be on your mind.</p>
<p>Price Factor: While booking a hotel and not considering the monetary value might not do justice with this post. Before making a final call, consider various other value added services including laundry,extended hour room service etc that can make your stay more comfortable. Search for hotel that offer attractive price with luxurious accommodation in your budget. You can also perform an online comparison among various available options.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-590" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-12-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />Reviews: Don’t miss out to check the reviews. Look out for reviews shared by various people who have stayed there to know whether their experience is good or bad. Online travel forums, hotel review sites and social media sites can help you in finding the one that you yearn for. There is probability of finding a negative review too as it differs from person to person. Make a wise decision.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-592" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-14-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" />Accessibility: Easy accessibility by air, road or train along with parking facility is what one should look for. Availability of hotel shuttle service to nearby airport, railway station and other tourist attractions can be a plus point. If not, easy accessibility to public transport should be there to make things more manageable. Size of accommodation along with other facilities and some sort of loyalty benefits are some other factors that you should consider.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all heard the hotel horror stories. Fear of bedbugs, filthy, rooms and disturbing discoveries are enough to make any traveler paranoid about the quality of his or her hotel room. While the details do vary from hotel to hotel, there are a handful of things worth considering before and during any hotel stay.</p>
<p>1. Compare rates<br />
<img class="alignleft wp-image-570" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-33-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-33-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-33.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Call it strange but it’s sometimes possible to book a nicer hotel one at its cheaper competitor’s rates by giving them a call. So while booking online is very convenient, a call to the hotel informing of a competitive rate by a bitter competitor might just be the key to getting lower rates than any web-based reservation.</p>
<p>2. Check reviews<br />
Every hotel claims to be clean and comfortable, but reviews from previous guests are the best way to get a brutally honest opinion.</p>
<p>3. Check independent hotels<br />
Smaller hotels that aren’t part of a large chain are often open to more negotiation than brand-name hotels. You may be able to haggle your way to better rates. Hyatt, Ibis and Days Hotels may be more well-known but you’re also paying a bit higher to the brand-names they carry.</p>
<p>4. Call the hotel<br />
<img class="wp-image-572 alignright" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-35-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-35-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-35.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you’re planning to book your stay through a third-party website, give the hotel a call. They usually offer better rates directly, and it’ll be easier to make changes later on. As mentioned in item (1), calling the hotel may take longer booking than web-based transaction, but that’s sometimes how they offer rates. So pick up your phone and give them a ring — then compare their rates with what they offer online.</p>
<p>5. Remember the check-In time<br />
You arrived earlier than expected and want to take a short break at the hotel a few hours before intended check-in time. This may give you a boost for your activities in the next few hours but it also means rushing staff to clean up, possibly compromising the cleanliness of your room. Never show up before the rooms are ready. You don’t want the cleaning staff to be rushed any more than they already are. Check-in time is usually 2pm so it’s good to arrange your journey so you reach the hotel at this hour.</p>
<p>6. Be Friendly<br />
It pays to treat hotel staff with smile and warmth. Friendlier guests are sometimes given perks such as free room upgrades and complimentary hot meals. They’re not your servants to be treated as such. And it’s easy to get back to you — watch out those pillows, bathrobes or bathroom glasses — if you act beyond what’s socially acceptable.</p>
<p>7. Disable Long-Distance Calling<br />
<img class="alignleft wp-image-573" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-28-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-28-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-28.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you aren’t using it, have it turned off. Employees have been known to make calls from a guest’s room while they’re away. Although it’s easier to trace the call in your bill, you don’t want to be bothered with such nuisance that can cost you 15 minutes or more of your check out time.</p>
<p>8. Ask the bellman<br />
Typically, the bellman has the ability to make your stay nicer, and if you ask nicely, he may be willing to slip you extra perks.</p>
<p>9. Inspect your room<br />
<img class="wp-image-574 alignright" src="http://localhost/stafford/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-25-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-25-272x182.jpg 272w, https://hotelinstratfordlondon..web.app/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotels-25.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Rooms aren’t cleaned as thoroughly as you’d probably hope. It’s best to request fresh blankets when checking in to avoid sleeping in someone else’s filth. You don’t want to end up ranting on a travel review website on how bad your experience at that hotel; just avoid the experience by doing a bit of diligence check.</p>
<p>10. Check the Mini-Bar<br />
Watch for expired products and broken seals. If the staff didn’t catch it when the last guest left, you might get stuck with the bill. Easy to check, just like the long-distance phone bill, but can be very annoying to be charged for something you didn’t use or consume.</p>
